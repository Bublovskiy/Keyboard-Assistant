# Keyboard-Assistant
Virtual keyboard with your native language keys written in Java with Intellij idea.

The main idea of the app is to provide a visual imitation of the keyboard with keys other than English. 
It is meant to help people who have laptops or desktop computers with only English letters keyboards. 

The programm uses JNativeHook libraly which allows the app to listen for type events globaly even being not in focus.

How it works:

- run the app to get the visual keyboard on your screen
- choose the first and the second languages (e.g. English - Arabic)
- now you can see whre Arabic keys are 
- type your message in any ither resourse keeping the app open and on top to see the references
- every time you hit the button you see the activity echoed in the app 


It was a funny exercise for Java to learn IntelliJ Idea enviroment.
